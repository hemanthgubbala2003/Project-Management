USE CASE: When there is an urgent need to produce a product which can be developed in an incremental approach


Step 1: Stake holder vision document

	Document which contains the following
	
	• High-level scope
	• High-level release plan
	• Who are your customers
	• What mechanism will you use to gather feedback on your product
	• Acceptance Criteria
	• Anything else you can think of that could impact the project
	
		
Step 2:  Create a talent and skills spreadsheet

Step 3:  Scrum Board


Step 4: The Sprint(iterations)

Sprint: Short working cycles , at the end of which an updated , working product is delivered(Typically one-two weeks).
	
	Sprint planning : This meeting is used to decide what work will occur in the               
	                            upcoming sprint.
	
	Daily Scrum : Fifteen minute meeting to discuss about updates and team 
	                       experiences.
	
				What did I do yesterday?
				What do I plan to do today?
				Is there anything blocking my work?
				
				
	Sprint Review : Goal is to demonstrate working software and to gain feedback from 
				stakeholders.
	
	Retrospective : This is an opportunity for introspection and plans for improvement              
	                          for next sprint
	
	
	
Step 5: Product Backlog
	
	Backlog: It is a list of all the work that needs to be done.
	
		 It is a set of epics, features and user stories.
		
		
Work is broken down into chunks small enough to create , test and deliver within a sprint. It is broken down into these categories:
		
		Feature: A main functionality of the final product.
		
		Epic: A way to break features into smaller chunks of work.
		
		User Story: A user-centric way to capture requirements and break down epics. The user story is small enough to be designed, coded, and tested in one iteration.
		
		Task: Individual units of work to be performed.
		
		
Step 6 : Create User Stories
	
	Based on
	What
	It describes a feature (or component of a feature) and is short and simple.
	
	Who
	It’s from the perspective of the person who will use the feature.
	
	Why
	It incorporates the “value” of the feature so the team knows what is driving this request.
	
	When
	User stories are prioritized in terms of when they’ll be completed.
