Align people and objectives:

Create a project Charter (Your charter will contain high-level information, including the intended project objectives, project scope, schedule, risks, etc. )

Objective : business goals that project has to accomplish
Scope: work performed to deliver the product with specified features and functions
Risks: Uncertain event that has an effect on at least one project objective


Project Planning:

Know your stakeholders (Empathy Map)
	- All the stakeholders, their motivations and needs
     Empathy Map is used to document and detail attribute of customers and stakeholders

Get a grip on project requirements
	-Tasks that must be completed to ensure the project success
         - Interviews, Surveys and Observation
	
Break down the work
	- The goal is to define the work, and break it down into chunks small enough to be easily delivered.
	- Work Breakdown Structure

	
Sequence the work
	
	- The goal here is to create a realistic schedule of what it takes to get your planned work done.
	- Tasks should sequenced in a way that shows dependencies.
	- Project Schedule Network Diagram


Determine who does the work
	- Determine skills necessary to deliver the outcomes of the project and match the skills with talent

Create the project schedule
	
	-Your schedule should show project goals, resources, and tasks to your project schedule.
	- To make schedule we need
		○ Work Breakdown Structure
		○ Project Schedule network diagram
		○ Talents and skills spreadsheet
	

Know your risks & create mitigation plans:

	An event is something that could happen during a project.
	
	A risk is a consequence of an event.
	

	Categorizing Risks:
	
		Avoidance: Remove risky areas from the project scope.
		
		Mitigation:  Do some risk response planning to reduce the likelihood of occurrence.
		
		Transferral: Move risky work to someone else.
		
		Acceptance: Accept and deal with the risk.
		
	We can use risk register to capture risks in a likelihood vs cost grid. We can also calculate the risk 
		                  exposure = probability * impact
		
		


Review the plan with your sponsors

	Project plan can include the documents like:
		
		Project Charter
		Kick-off Presentation
		Work Breakdown Structure
		Project Network Schedule Diagram
		Talents & Skills Spreadsheet
		Project Schedule
		Risk Register
		Risk Analysis
		Risk Response Plan
		Empathy Map
		Burn-down Chart
		
		
Getting work done:

	Make use of status reports and burn-down charts
